### Cookie and Local Storage

#### Strictly Necessary cookies

Strictly Necessary cookies are essential to providing our Services to you and cannot be turned off.
- Our service provider Cloudflare (as mentioned above) may place bot detection cookies (such as "_cf_bm"), cookies for CAPTCHA products (like cf_chl_prog, cf_clearance, cf_chl_cc_XXX, cf_chl_seq_XXX, cf_chl_rc_i and cf_chl_rc_ni), and a load balancing cookie (_cflb) on the computers of visitors to our Services. Cloudflare do this in order to identify malicious visitors to our Services, to assist with web-traffic filtration, and to reduce the chance of blocking legitimate users. You can learn more about these cookies [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/reference/policies-compliances/cloudflare-cookies/). You cannot turn off Strictly Necessary cookies.

#### Analytics cookies

Analytics cookies collect information about your use of our Services and enable us to improve the way they work.

- Our Services use Google Analytics (as mentioned above) to collect analytics data. You can opt-out of this service by using a script blocker to block [https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-KH8KBJD6HN](https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-KH8KBJD6HN), or a domain blocker to block [https://www.googletagmanager.com](https://www.googletagmanager.com). You can learn more about Google Analytics cookies [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11397207).

#### Local Storage

Local Storage is a method of storing data locally in your browser. It is similar to cookies, but has a higher capacity and does not send data to the server with every request.

- Our site uses local storage to record your theme preference (system, light or dark) to enhance your browsing experience.
- Our Services use giscus (as mentioned above) which, if you sign in using GitHub, stores a server-encrypted token in your browser's local storage to facilitate authenticated requests to the GitHub API, allowing you to remain signed in; for more details, please refer to the [giscus Privacy Policy](https://github.com/giscus/giscus/blob/main/PRIVACY-POLICY.md) and [GitHub's Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement).

### Security

While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so, such as monitoring our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may change this Privacy Policy at any time. All changes will be published on this site. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we publish the revised Privacy Policy on our website. Your use of our Services following these changes means that you accept the revised Privacy Policy. Therefore, we ask you to review our Privacy Policy from time to time.
